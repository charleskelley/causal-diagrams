## About The Course

Causal diagrams have revolutionized the way in which researchers ask: What is
the causal effect of X on Y? They have become a key tool for researchers who
study the effects of treatments, exposures, and policies.

By summarizing and communicating assumptions about the causal structure of a
problem, causal diagrams have helped clarify apparent paradoxes, describe
common biases, and identify adjustment variables. As a result, a sound
understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many
scientific disciplines.

The first part of this course is comprised of seven lessons that introduce
causal diagrams and its applications to causal inference. The first lesson
introduces causal DAGs, a type of causal diagrams, and the rules that govern
them. The second, third, and fourth lessons use causal DAGs to represent common
forms of bias. The fifth lesson uses causal DAGs to represent time-varying
treatments and treatment-confounder feedback, as well as the bias of
conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment. The sixth lesson
introduces SWIGs, another type of causal diagrams. The seventh lesson guides
learners in constructing causal diagrams.

The second part of the course presents a series of case studies that highlight
the practical applications of causal diagrams to real-world questions from the
health and social sciences.
