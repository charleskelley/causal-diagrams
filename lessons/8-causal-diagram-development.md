## Causal Diagram Development

### Key Researchers

We had the honor to interview Professors Judea Pearl and James Robins. These
two researchers have both played critical roles in developing causal diagrams
and we value the insight they had to provide. In these interviews they talk
about why they became interested in causal diagrams, and what contributions
they have made to the field of causal inference. They reflect on the impact
causal diagrams have had on causal research and they describe the limitations
of causal diagrams.  We're excited to share these discussions with you.

**Judea Pearl** is a professor of computer science and statistics at the
University of California, Los Angeles. He is known for his contributions to
artificial intelligence, human reasoning, and philosophy of science. He is the
author of Heuristics (1984), Probabilistic Reasoning (1988), and Causality
(2000; 2009).

**James Robins** is the Mitchell L. and Robin LaFoley Dong Professor of
Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. His research has
focused on time-varying exposures or treatments and the use of a g-estimators
to estimate the the respective causal effects. He is a co-author of the
upcoming textbook “[Causal Inference](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)”.
