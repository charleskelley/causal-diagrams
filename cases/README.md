# Case Descriptions

This portion of the course includes four conversations with epidemiologists who
focus on a wide range of research topics. Each one will discuss a different way
that causal diagrams informed a research question and impacted their analysis.

### 1) The Birthweight Paradox

Dr. Allen Wilcox discusses the “birth weight paradox,” the phenomena by which
small babies from a population with higher infant mortality often have better
survival than small babies from a lower-risk population. Potential bias is
described and illustrated using causal diagrams. 

### 2) Measurement Bias in Memory Loss 

Dr. Maria Glymour discusses the effect of education on memory loss at older
age. She explains the differences between studying the effects of memory at one
point in time versus changes in memory over time. Bias due to measurement error
and regression to the mean are illustrated using causal diagrams. 

### 3) Confounding in Mediation Analysis

Dr. Tyler VanderWeele discusses mediation as it relates to the estimation of
the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on depression.  He distinguishes
direct and indirect effects and describes methods to estimate them. He uses
causal diagrams to explain the assumptions needed for mediation analysis.
Potential sensitivity analyses are explored.   

### 4) Genes as Instrumental Variables

Dr. Sonja Swanson discusses the use of genes as instrumental variables to
estimate the effects of alcohol use on health. The assumptions required for a
valid instrument are described and represented using causal diagrams.

### 5) The Obesity Paradox

Dr. Jay Kauffman discusses "the obesity paradox," which describes the
counterintuitive findings that obesity is protective against certain diseases,
such as heart disease. Causal diagrams are used to describe the study designs
and identify the source of bias.
